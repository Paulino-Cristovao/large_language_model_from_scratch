    "This chapter introduces **Large Language Models (LLMs)** by covering their **fundamental concepts, architecture, training methodologies, and applications**. The key objectives include understanding how LLMs work, their structural components, and real-world use cases. The chapter also provides an example implementation of a simple language model to give hands-on experience. ðŸš€"

    "1. What is an LLM (Large Language Model)?\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced deep learning models designed to process, generate, and understand human-like text. They are trained on vast amounts of textual data using self-supervised learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics of LLMs:\n",
    "Scale: LLMs have billions of parameters, enabling them to generate high-quality text.\n",
    "Context Awareness: They understand and generate coherent text by leveraging attention mechanisms.\n",
    "Few-shot Learning: They can perform tasks with minimal examples.\n",
    "Generalization: Trained on diverse datasets, they can handle various NLP tasks without fine-tuning.\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ Sebastian Raschka emphasizes that LLMs rely heavily on Transformer architectures and require massive computational power for training."
