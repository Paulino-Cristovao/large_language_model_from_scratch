# Chapter 1: Introduction to Large Language Models

## Overview
Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of large language models (LLMs). It covers the basic principles of natural language processing (NLP) and sets the stage for understanding how LLMs function.

## Key Concepts
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: An overview of NLP and its significance in AI.
- **Large Language Models**: Introduction to what LLMs are and their applications.
- **Training Data**: Discussion on the importance of data in training LLMs.
- **Model Architecture**: Basic understanding of neural networks and their role in LLMs.

## Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
1. Understand the basic concepts of NLP and LLMs.
2. Recognize the significance of training data and model architecture.
3. Prepare for more advanced topics in subsequent chapters.

## Background Information
This chapter assumes a basic understanding of machine learning concepts. Familiarity with Python programming will be beneficial for the exercises included in the accompanying Jupyter notebook.

## Exercises
The exercises in the Jupyter notebook (`chapter1.ipynb`) will help reinforce the concepts covered in this chapter. You will implement basic NLP tasks and explore the workings of LLMs through hands-on coding.
