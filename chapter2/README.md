# Chapter 2 Overview

In Chapter 2, we delve into the foundational concepts of large language models, focusing on their architecture and the underlying principles that govern their functionality. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these models are structured and the key components that contribute to their performance.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Model Architecture**: An exploration of the various architectures used in large language models, including transformers and recurrent neural networks.
- **Training Mechanisms**: A discussion on the training processes, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: An overview of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of language models.

## Objectives

By the end of this chapter, readers should be able to:

1. Understand the basic architecture of large language models.
2. Identify the key components that influence model performance.
3. Recognize different training methodologies and their implications.
