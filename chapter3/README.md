# Chapter 3 Overview

## Key Points
In this chapter, we delve into the intricacies of large language models, focusing on their architecture and the underlying principles that govern their functionality. We will explore the following key concepts:

- **Model Architecture**: Understanding the structure of large language models, including layers, attention mechanisms, and tokenization.
- **Training Techniques**: An overview of the methodologies used to train these models effectively, including supervised and unsupervised learning.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Discussing how to assess the performance of language models and the metrics commonly used in the field.

## Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Describe the architecture of large language models.
- Explain the training techniques used for these models.
- Evaluate the performance of language models using appropriate metrics.

## Background Information
This chapter builds upon the foundational concepts introduced in Chapter 2. It is recommended to review the previous chapter to fully grasp the advanced topics discussed here.

## Exercises
The accompanying Jupyter notebook (`chapter3.ipynb`) contains practical exercises and code implementations that reinforce the concepts covered in this chapter. Make sure to run the notebook and complete the exercises to solidify your understanding.
